To Do List:
=== DSR ===  Target on: 
1. Routing table: Currently we have the single-entry routing table, i.e. only showing a single next hop's IP address and the corresponding cost to reach the destination.    
Our goal: Routing table with multiple entries to the same destination.
i.e.			------------------------------------
			 Dst	Gateway	    Cost     Type
			------------------------------------
			  w       u1        D1(w,u)     DG    (Dealy-guaranteed)
			-------------------------------------
			
i.e.			------------------------------------
			 Dst	Gateway	    Cost     Type
			------------------------------------
			  w       u2          -        BE    (Best-effort)
			-------------------------------------

2. Routing algorithm: Currently the routes are calculated based on per-hop cost for the DG traffic only. The route for BE is missing. Also we hope to reserve more path options in the routing table. 
Our goal: Researve path diversity for DG traffic, i.e. show more routes in the routing table by using lower granularity of per-hop cost.
	  Apply different routing algorithm for different traffics. 

2. Bug: Last hop does not show total cost --> Output "error: time expire", sent to fast lane

3. WRR weight scheduling: Currently the weight assigned to each lane is fixed values. 
Our goal: dynamic, adaptive weight scheduling scheme.

Finish by: 

4. Applications: Currently only the UDP-CBR traffics are used in the simulation. TCP traffic failed to work due to module modification.
Our goal: Apply TCP traffic to run the simluations

Finish by: 

5. Statistics collection: Currently total delay cost of all sinkApps are recorded. 
Our goal: Record the target sinkApps only, i.e. the target traffic flows.

====================== Recent To Do ===========================
RXY:
1. Set FlagTag to distinguish target flow from others --- done
2. Trace queue length of each node --- done
3. Fix last hop issue
4. Try to record per-hop budget to file
5. Adjust Max Queue Size for each lane 

Pu:
1. Separate two routing algorithm for DSR and BE traffics
